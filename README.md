# Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a straightforward encryption method used in classical cryptography. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a set number of positions.

This project demonstrates how to implement Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption in [programming language], aiming to provide educational insights into basic cryptographic techniques.

Features
1. Encrypt Messages: Convert plaintext into ciphertext.
2. Decrypt Messages: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext.
3. Customizable Shift: Choose your own shift value (key) for encryption and decryption.
Usage
Encryption
1. Enter your plaintext message and choose a shift value (key).
2. Run the encryption algorithm.
3. Receive your encrypted message (ciphertext).
Decryption
1. Enter the ciphertext and the shift value (key) used for encryption.
2. Run the decryption algorithm.
3. Get back the original plaintext message.
